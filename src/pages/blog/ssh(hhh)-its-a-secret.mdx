[ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) is a vital tool in the programmer's arsenal. Enabling the ability to login to servers remotely
via the terminal. While this is the main functionality of ssh, there is plenty of things it offers that can improve your usage
and understanding of ssh. I won't be covering; [creating your own identity via ssh keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id#generate-an-ssh-key),
[ssh-copy-id](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id#copy-the-key-to-a-server), using ssh with git, or the fact that sftp, scp and rsync use ssh.
But if you think I should, do reach out to me.

Note: Information in this article is about [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/), which is the main binary and standard of the ssh util.

### 1. Don't remember, use `~/.ssh/config`

ssh allows you to set configurations for remote hosts, this [config file](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config) lives in `.ssh`
within your home directory. You can also make a global configuration at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` for all users on your system
but usually, this isn't desired. A simple use-case for this is adding friendly names to your servers.
So stop remembering IP addresses and Hostnames, just alias them.
```sh
# ~/.ssh/config

Host myserver
    Hostname 192.168.1.10
    User     admin

Host myotherserver
    Hostname 192.168.1.23
    User     administrator
```

This enables me to do `ssh myserver` or `ssh myotherserver`, rather than `ssh admin@192.168.1.10` or `ssh administrator@192.168.1.23` respectively.
This is the most basic usage of the config file, but it offers way more than just this. A full list can be
[found here](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config), I will be covering a few more within the following headings.


#### 1a. Separate your configs
I have multiple config files for personal, organisational and work. I keep them in `~/.ssh/config.d/` and have my main config
file include them all. This allows me to easily seperate them and share them with colleagues without having to remove my personal configs.
```sh
# ~/.ssh/config
Include config.d/*

Host * # oh yeah! you can use wildcards in hostnames
    Compression yes

# ~/.ssh/config.d/home
Host myserver
    Hostname 192.168.1.10
    User     user

# ~/.ssh/config.d/work
Host webserver
    Hostname 192.168.7.23
    User     admin
```

### 2. Secure PortForwarding

One major issue I have faced when working with remote servers is the firewall. Which is good! it means it's doing its job, as just
having the IP of the device doesn't mean I should be able to access running services such as Grafana, Databases, etc.

ssh enables you to forward traffic from your system to the remote system over the "secure channel" on port `:22`
which is then directed to the port you specify from the remote system.

To do this you can use `-L`. For example, if I wanted to access port `:3000` (typically Grafana) on the remote system I could use
`ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 remotesystem` the format is `port:host:hostport`, it took me a little bit to understand how this comes
into play, hopefully a small diagram helps.

#### 2a. Bonus! PortForward in your config.
I learnt while writing this that you can specify ports to forward for specific hosts in your `~/.ssh/config` file! Wow, now I don't have
to disconnect and forward `:3000` to see grafana each time.
```sh
# ~/.ssh/config

Host myserver
    Hostname     192.168.1.10
    User         admin
    LocalForward 3000 127.0.0.1:3000
```

### 3. Using git remotely via ssh

First things first, this functionality I used is considered a security issue. Please beware and
[understand the risk](https://heipei.github.io/2015/02/26/SSH-Agent-Forwarding-considered-harmful/).

An issue I faced while configuring our [AbandonTech](https://abandontech.cloud) server was pushing commits from a remote host after
making changes. Our strategy was to maintain a git repository in the root folder of our deployment and then to keep it synchronized
with a privately hosted git repository. This means duplication and/or recreation would be possible in dire situations.

I was able to author commits on the system, after configuring my git identity so I appeared as the correct user, but pushing those
authored commits was not going to be as simple. I could set up a rsync session to allow me to maintain a copy of the deployment
locally and on the server (including the `.git` folder). Which could lead me to overwrite changes created by other members of
the organisation on accident.

The simple solution for me was `ForwardAgent`. This is can be done by simply adding `-A` to your ssh connection, or adding it into your
`~/.ssh/config`.
```sh
# ~/.ssh/config

Host myserver
    Hostname     192.168.1.10
    User         admin
    ForwardAgent yes
```

So doing `ssh -A abandontechserver` allowed me to then `git push` to my heart's content. Do remember that `-J` or "Jump" is a safer
alternative, and I may update this article to explain it once I get to using it.

### That's all folks

Well, that is it. A few incredibly useful features of ssh that "nobody told me about"... Well Google did, but I had to venture out
on my own to find them. Hopefully it helps!
