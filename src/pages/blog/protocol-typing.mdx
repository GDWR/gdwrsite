[Protocol typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol) was introduced in Python 3.8 in
[PEP 544](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) and is supported by the two big players in Python static analysis --
[MyPy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol) and [
Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/features.md#type-checking-features). It enables developers to
type by what objects do rather than what objects inherit. For a brief example so this hopefully starts to make sense, lets make one.

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Readable(Protocol):
    def read(self) -> str: ...
```

Our protocol is relatively simple, a `Readable` object has to have a `read()` method that returns a `str`. Straight away we can
use this interface in a function, even though we haven't written any implementations yet.

```python
def write_to_file(reader: Readable, filepath: str) -> None:
    with open(filepath, "w") as f:
        # as reader is Readable, it must have .read() -> str
        f.write(reader.read())
```

If we run [MyPy on the code](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=495b48e01b44d5139b89b771fbb5477e) we get
no issues and a gold star. As we expect a `Readable` object to have a `.read()` function, this is fully typesafe. Now lets try to use
this function.

For this lets start by using a object that Python already has builtin. Lets open the source file, and write it to another file.

```python
# Note: __name__ is the absolute path to the source file
with open(__name__, "r") as file:
    write_to_file(file, "file.out")
```

[Again, MyPy](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=1f1d1fbad94dc88c782b58b16ff95c38) gives us the all clear as
`file` object has a `.read()` method that returns a `str`. So you can start to see that `Readable` is a Type that ensures an object
has the structure you have defined. Lets make our own class follow the `Readable` protocol to understand why this is powerful in
contrast to inheritance.

We are implementing an object to represent a website. This takes in a url, and on read will make a http request using the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, returning the page content as text.

```python
import requests


class Website:  # Notice no inheritance
    def __init__(self, url: str) -> None:
        self.url = url

    def read(self) -> str:
        response = requests.get(self.url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
```

As our `Website` object implements the `Readable` protocol by having the `def read(self) -> str:` method signature, we can use it in
our `write_to_file` function.

```python
my_website = Website("https://h.pythondiscord.com")

write_to_file(my_website, "website.out")
```

Once again, [MyPy is happy with this](https://gist.github.com/GDWR/2dd090fb24c8eb87d696f931e6d76c95). As you can see, we are able
to use two completely different implementations that have no inherited functionality in the same function while remaining typesafe.
