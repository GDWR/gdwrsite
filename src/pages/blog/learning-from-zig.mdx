[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is yet another general-purpose programming language, that I had _an experience with_ I used it during my Advent of Code 2022 adventure.[^1]
Zig prides itself on not hiding any allocations, control flow or another wizardry. Syntactically is the middle ground between Go and Rust, in my opinion, of course.

[^1]: During [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) I attempted to use a new language each day to solve the problem, [you can find it here.](https://github.com/gdwr/aoc2022).

[//]: # (## Hello Zig)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Here is the "Hello World" in Zig. Let's break it down to gain an understanding of the Zig basics.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```zig)

[//]: # (const std = @import&#40;"std"&#41;;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (pub fn main&#40;&#41; void {)

[//]: # (    std.debug.print&#40;"Hello, {s}!\n", .{"World"}&#41;;)

[//]: # (})

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Zig uses the built-in [@import]&#40;https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#import&#41; function with an assignment as a constant.)

[//]: # (This defines the symbol to access the package's functions, struct, etc.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The entrypoint function[^2] is named `main` and defined as a public symbol. It has a void return type, as nothing will be returned.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ([^2]: An Entrypoint Function is where the execution of a program begins, it is passed arguments that have been supplied by the caller.)

[//]: # (In most languages, the function is expected to be `main` and a public &#40;static in the case of OOP&#41; symbol.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now for the unintuitive part...)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```zig)

[//]: # (std.debug.print&#40;"Hello, {s}!\n", .{"World"}&#41;;)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (So we are using the imported `std` package to access the [`debug` namespace]&#40;https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;debug&#41;)

[//]: # (which has the [print&#40;&#41; function]&#40;https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;debug.print&#41;. Here we take in a format string that is)

[//]: # (similar to the famous [printf]&#40;https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/&#41;, but using `{}` rather than `%`. The `s` is explicitly templating a string.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now... why do I have to provide the templated variables in this weird `.{variable_name}` syntax??? Let's investigate the)

[//]: # ([print&#40;&#41; function's]&#40;https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;debug.print&#41; signature.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```zig)

[//]: # (print&#40;comptime fmt: []const u8, args: anytype&#41; void)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We have the format string `fmt` as a `[]const u8` that is expected to be known at compile time as it is denoted with `comptime`. Due to the parameter)

[//]: # (being defined as `[]u8`, the provided format string will be interpreted as ASCII. For reference, the Unicode would be `[]u21`... What a headache to even think about.[^3])
